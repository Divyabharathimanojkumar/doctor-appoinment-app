Ai Resume Analyzer
Code Explanation & Features
1. Resume Text Extraction
The code extracts text from uploaded PDFs using PyPDF2.
This ensures we can analyze resumes regardless of their format.
2. AI Resume Analysis
Uses spaCy NLP to extract skills and work experience from the resume.
Keywords like Python, React, Machine Learning are pre-set but can be expanded dynamically.
3. AI Cover Letter Generator
Uses OpenAI GPT-4 API to generate a tailored cover letter.
It matches the cover letter to the job description + extracted resume data.
How is this Unique?
📊 Skill-Based Resume Analysis – Instead of just parsing text, it intelligently extracts skills & experience.
📝 AI Cover Letter Generator – Many resume analyzers don’t generate tailored cover letters dynamically.
🚀 FastAPI for Speed – Unlike Flask, FastAPI makes this system faster and more scalable.
📡 API Ready for Integration – Can be used in job portals, ATS systems, or LinkedIn integrations.

Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn filename:app --reload
(Replace filename with the actual Python script name.)
